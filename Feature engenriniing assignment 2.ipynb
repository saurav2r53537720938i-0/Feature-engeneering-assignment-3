    "The filter method in feature selection involes selecting feature based on their statistical properties suchh as correlation with the target variable or information gain.it works by evaluating each feature independent of the others and ranking them based on certain criteria.Feature with the hightest score are slected for the highest score are selected for the model.This method is computationally efficent but may not consider interaction between features."

    "The wrapper method differs from the filter method in feature slection by evaluating subsets of feature based on the  performance of a specfic machine learning model.it works by creating diffrent combination of feature,traning a model.it works by creating diffrent combination of feature training model on each sbset and slecting the subset that yields the best performance according to a chosen evaluation metric .unlike the filter method wrapper method consider the interaction between feature but can be computationally expensive especially for large feature sets."
